# CSS Display Property

This project explores the CSS `display` property, which plays a crucial role in determining how elements are rendered on a webpage. The code provided demonstrates various aspects of the `display` property and its effects on element layout and visibility.

## Project Overview

The HTML file `index.html` contains a simple webpage structure with multiple `<div>` and `<span>` elements styled using CSS. Each element has a distinct class name associated with it for styling purposes.

### CSS Styling

The CSS code included in the `<style>` block resets margins, padding, and box-sizing for all elements using the universal selector `*`. It then defines styling rules for the boxes and hidden content.

- **.box**: Styles the boxes with a red background, white text, and rounded corners. The `display: inline-block;` property is used to allow elements to flow horizontally.
- **.box1**: Styles the hidden content within one of the boxes. By default, it's set to `display: block;`, but you can toggle between different display properties (`display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;`) by uncommenting the respective lines.

## CSS Display Property

### Display Values

The `display` property in CSS determines how an element is displayed on the webpage. It can take various values, each affecting the layout differently:

1. **`block`**: Renders the element as a block-level element, taking up the full width available and starting on a new line.
2. **`inline`**: Renders the element as an inline-level element, allowing other elements to be displayed on the same line.
3. **`inline-block`**: Combines features of both `block` and `inline`, allowing the element to be displayed inline while still respecting width and height properties.
4. **`none`**: Hides the element completely, removing it from the layout flow and making it invisible.
5. **`flex`**: Establishes a flex container, enabling flexible layouts using flexbox properties.

### Hidden Content

The code includes an example of hidden content within one of the boxes, demonstrating two common techniques:

- **`display: none;`**: Completely hides the content, removing it from the layout flow and making it invisible.
- **`visibility: hidden;`**: Hides the content while preserving its space in the layout.
