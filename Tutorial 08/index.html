<!--The .highlight class is defined in the style block within the <head> section. Elements with this class will have red text and bold font weight.
    The #special-id id is also defined in the style block, and the background color of the element with this id will be yellow.
    The <p> elements with the class "highlight" are styled according to the .highlight class.
    The <div> element with the id "special-id" is styled according to the #special-id id.
    You can see how classes and ids are used to apply styles to specific elements in the HTML document. Additionally, they are commonly used with JavaScript for scripting purposes. -->
