    This code snippet demonstrates the usage of semantic tags in HTML.
    Semantic tags are HTML elements that provide meaning and structure to the content of a web page.
    By using semantic tags, developers can improve the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and maintainability of their web pages.
    Some commonly used semantic tags in HTML include:
    - <header>: Represents the introductory content or a group of navigational links at the top of a web page.
    - <nav>: Represents a section of a web page that contains navigation links.
    - <main>: Represents the main content of a web page.
    - <article>: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, such as a blog post or a news article.
    - <section>: Represents a standalone section of a web page.
    - <aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars or pull quotes.
    - <footer>: Represents the footer of a web page or a section.
    By using these semantic tags appropriately, developers can improve the structure and accessibility of their web pages, making them more meaningful and easier to understand for both humans and machines.
