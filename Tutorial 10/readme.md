# Web Development Tutorial 10

This project demonstrates the usage of semantic tags in HTML and how to make a webpage interactive using CSS.

## HTML

The HTML file (`index.html`) in this project uses semantic HTML tags to structure the web content. Semantic tags add meaning to your HTML. They tell both the browser and the developer what kind of content is being presented. Some of the semantic tags used in this project include:

- `<header>`: Represents the introductory content or a group of navigational links at the top of a web page.
- `<nav>`: Represents a section of a web page that contains navigation links.
- `<main>`: Represents the main content of a web page.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a web page or a section.

You can view the HTML file here.

## CSS

The CSS file (`style.css`) in this project styles the navigation menu and highlights the selected item. The CSS makes the navigation menu interactive, changing the color of the menu item when you hover over it and highlighting the current page.

You can view the CSS file here.

## How to Run

To view the webpage, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Make sure the `style.css` file is in the same directory as the `index.html` file for the styles to be applied correctly.
