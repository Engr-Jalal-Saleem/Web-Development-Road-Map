# Introduction to CSS with HTML

This project demonstrates three ways to add CSS to an HTML document: Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file that contains examples of the three methods of adding CSS.

## HTML File

The HTML file contains the following sections:

1. **Inline CSS**: Inline CSS is used to apply styles directly to a specific HTML element. This is done by adding the `style` attribute to the HTML tag.
2. **Internal CSS**: Internal CSS is used to define styles in the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of the HTML document. This allows you to define styles that can be used throughout the document.
3. **External CSS**: External CSS is used when the CSS is defined in a separate file and then linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. This allows you to keep your CSS separate from your HTML, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Usage

To view the HTML file, simply open it in your web browser. The different CSS styles will be applied to the text in each section.
