# Responsive Web Design Showcase

Welcome to our responsive web design showcase! üåê This project demonstrates the power of various CSS units to create a visually appealing and adaptable webpage.

## Features

### Viewport Units:

- **Viewport Width (`vw`):**
  - The first box (`box` class) dynamically adjusts its width based on 80% of the viewport width.
- **Viewport Height (`vh`):**
  - The first box also adjusts its height based on 35% of the viewport height.

### Additional Units:

- **Viewport Minimum (`vmin`):**

  - The third container (`mycont` class) ensures its width is at least 100% of the minimum viewport dimension, providing a robust layout.
- **Root Em (`rem`) and Relative Em (`em`):**

  - Font sizes are set using `rem` in the main container, ensuring scalability relative to the root element's font size.
  - Nested divs use `em` for font sizing relative to their parent.
- **Pixel (`px`):**

  - Border widths, such as the 2px border on the first box and 4px border on the main container, provide precise styling.
- **Viewport Maximum (`vmax`):**

  - Consider experimenting with `vmax` for a maximum value relative to the viewport.
